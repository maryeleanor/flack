## Project 2 for CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

---
This is an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users can sign in with a display name, create channels/chatrooms to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users can send and receive messages with one another in real time.
