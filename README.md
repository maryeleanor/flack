---

This is an online messaging service built with javascript, python, flask and socketio. Similar in spirit to Slack. Users can sign in with a display name, create channels/chatrooms to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users can send and receive messages with one another in real time.  

Check it out on Heroku <a href="https://flack-maryeleanor.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" style="font-weight:bold;">here.</a>
